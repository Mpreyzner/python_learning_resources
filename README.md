### python_learning_resources

# Very opinioated list of resources for learning python

## Why? 
### To prevent being overwhelmed by sheer amount of the courses, books, blogs and tutorials
### I've compiled a short list of resources which in most cases should be more than enough.

## Are those resources THE BEST?
### Possibly no, but that shouldn't matter. They are good enough.

## What if I don't like some of those?
### Then feel free to use something different, most of the time it doesn't matter much until you stop learning.
